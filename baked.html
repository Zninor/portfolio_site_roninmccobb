        <p> Baked is an app that shows users how to make Cannabases
          (cooking oils infused with THC) and how to add them to recipes
          to create delicious, high end edibles like desserts, snacks, and
          savory dinners.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Making food infused with marijuana (edibles) can be intimidating.
          If you don't know what you're doing, you can mess up the ratios and
          consume more THC than you'd like, inducing a bad reaction for yourself
          and others, or add too little and feel nothing at all.
        </p>
        <p> How can this become an easier and safer process that more people would feel comfortable trying? </p>

      <div>
        <p>I began by interviewing others who would be interested in such
          a product, to see what features they'd like to see. Here are some
          highlights from those interviews. </p>

      <div>
        <p>After interviewing several friends to see what they would want out
          of such an app, I created these personas to represent their various
          wants, needs, and barriers to making edibles.
        </p>

      <div>

        <p>After analyzing the various user needs I discovered through
          interviews, I condensed them all into a single Minimum Viable
          Product that Baked must achieve: The product must show users a
          variety of edible recipes and calculate dosages based on user
          preference, as well as calculate and save cannabases that users
          make to alleviate ratio errors. </p>
        <p> Now that the MVP has been defined, the flow of tasks can be
          visualized as a series of actions and pages that the user
          will go through. </p>

      <div>
        <p>These sketches represent the tasks and screens I came up with,
          and together form the first prototype that will be tested by users
          to see if the user flow is easy to follow.

      <div>
        <p> After having users test the paper prototype through inVision,
          these are the issues they had to report. On the following screen
          I will explain how I applied these suggestions to my wireframes.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p> Taking the feedback from the paper prototype, I began designing
          grayscale wireframes in Adobe XD in order to figure out how the
          UI elements should best be arranged.

      </div>

      <div>

        <p>I then made a style guide containing the color palette, typography,
          icons, and other visual elements to be included in the final version
          of the wireframes.

      <div>
        <p>I applied the style guide elements to my mid fidelity wireframes,
          and also made massive edits after receiving feedback from my class
          tutor, creating the final product for the mobile designs.

        <p>How do the final designs for Baked solve the hypothesis and user
          problems originally presented in this case study? How do users get
          to experience a better way to make edibles?

      <div>
        <p>Once the mobile designs were set, I began making responsive designs
          to fit iPad and computers. Here is the home screen, where the major
          difference is how many recipes are displayed side-by-side, as well
          as information on the top bar replacing the tucked away menu.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p>For this wireframe, I was able to place them side by side instead of
          stacking elements vertically, so more is viewable for the user at
          first glance. I also added a sidebar to show other recipes, and
          put the menu options on the top bar, rather than tucked away under
          a hamburger icon.

      <div>
        <p>For this wireframe, I also gave elements more room and placed
          them horizontally in order to show more on the first fold of the page.

        <h2> Retrospective </h2>
        <div>
          <h3> How did I decide on the MVP? </h3>
          <p> Through interviews, I learned that expanding the
            concept of the edible beyond sweets would make the
            whole process more appealing. Furthermore, it was
            absolutely essential that recipes could be applicable to
            any user, and that meant making dosages adjustable. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> What insights did I gain from testing? </h3>
          <p> It became clear that when making an app designed for novices,
            defining key terms such as cannabase, edible, THC, was necessary
            to avoid confusion. The user tests showed that when these terms
            were not clearly separated from one another, that users quickly
            got lost or thought one thing meant the other. This set the stage
            for the UI portion of this project, where I focused on making
            elements more clear to the user.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> What roadblocks did I encounter? </h3>
          <p> Placing the UI element for editing a recipe's THC content was crucial.
            It had to fit into the standard online recipe page, but still be
            present enough that users were drawn to it before diving into
            the cooking. This important step in the process was difficult
            to fit into the user flow without completely taking the user
            out of the flow, and went through many iterations throughout
            the project. </p>
