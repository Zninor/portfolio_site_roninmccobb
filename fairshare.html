        <p> FaireShare is a native application designed to help groups
          of users add multiple purchases to an overall bill and divide
          the cost amongst all users evenly with little hassle. With
          this app, users can individually pay for big purchases like
          restaurants, rideshare trips, and shared living costs and know
          they will only pay their fair share. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p> In order to further define the app and its Minimum Viable Product, I
          developed three user objectives to focus on. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and add friends on the app to a budget.</li>
          <li>Submit a purchase you made to a budget, to be later divided amongst all users. </li>
          <li>Pay a "finished" budget that the host has closed, sending or
            receiving money based on your purchases and division of cost. </li>
        </ul>

          <img src="img/fairshare/2app_introduction_big.jpg" alt="FairShare Case Study">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>After deciding on the main user objectives I would work on,
          I began drawing a user flow to decide what screens were necessary
          and how they should flow from one to another. Here, you can see
          the three tasks in a combined user flow to show how one would
          navigate the app. </p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/fairshare/3old_user_flows_small.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/fairshare/3old_user_flows_big.jpg" alt="FairShare Case Study">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>With the user flow ready, I began sketching low fidelity wireframes
          to get a sense of what the screens should look like to achieve the
          user objectives I laid out. With some minor edits, I then transferred
          these to Adobe XD as mid-fidelity wireframes </p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/fairshare/4low_mids_small.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/fairshare/4low_mids_big.jpg" alt="FairShare Case Study">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>

        <p>As I began designing the mid-fidelity wireframes, I realized my user
          flow did not quite make sense in how users created and paid for budgets.
          Now, instead of paying money for a newly found budget and withdrawing
          funds later, purchases are tallied until the host declares the budget
          is closed, then money is paid and dispersed amongst users. </p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/fairshare/5new_userflows_small.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/fairshare/5new_userflows_big.jpg" alt="FairShare Case Study">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>With a new user flow, some wireframes also had to be thought out differently.
          The Withdraw and Proof-of-Purchase page are replaced by an Add-Purchase
          page (where users post a purchase they've made for the budget, thus
          increasing the budget), a separate Payment page for once the entire
          budget is deemed completed, and a new Receipt page is added to show
          users who must pay what amount.
        </p>

          <source srcset="img/fairshare/6speedbump_small.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/fairshare/6speedbump_big.jpg" alt="FairShare Case Study">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> Once I completed the greyscale version of the app, I began working
          on a style guide to find the right typography, color palette, and
          UI pattern design.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/fairshare/7styleguide_small.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/fairshare/7styleguide_big.jpg" alt="FairShare Case Study">
        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> The original color for FairShare was meant to be orange - I wanted to
          stand out from other money apps like Venmo and Paypal that use blue, so
          I chose a bright, fun, and unique color palette.
        </p>
        <p> After a quick feedback round, I realized white and orange did not
          pair as well when it came to legibility.
        </p>
        <p> I decided to change to green: it's bright and pairs well with white,
          plus it symbolizes money so better fitting for FairShare while still
          unique from other money apps.
        </p>
        <p> A small feedback round yielded better results: less harsh on the eyes
          while still remaining bright and eye-catching.
        </p>

        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>

        <p>I then applied the finished style guide to my mid-fidelity screens to
          create a finished version of FaireShare, one I could share with others
          as a potential finished product.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I created a prototype of FaireShare using the high fidelity screens
          from the previous slide, and received feedback from testers on both
          the app's usability and the overall design. Here is what they had to say:

      <div>
        <p>Below are the resulting changes made from user feedback:

        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>These are the final versions of the FairShare screens designed for iOS.
          Below are also the original User Tasks, labeled under the screens that complete the goals.

      <div>
        <p>And these are the final designs for Android. Notable differences include
          Roboto font instead of SF Pro, a top navigation bar displaying the screen
          title, and more rigid boxes/buttons.

      <div>
        <h2> Retrospective </h2>
        <div>
          <h3> How did I interpret the original project brief? </h3>
          <p> The project brief was very open ended: create an app that will solve
            a user problem. I have often been the person amongst friends in college
            doing the bulk of group purchasing, and having to chase down individuals
            to pay me the $8.50 they owe me, often to no avail. I wanted to create
            something that would work to make that problem easier by keeping a
            running tally of purchases that everyone can see, along with proof
            of purchase so everyone feels like things are fair,
            and ease the burden of whoever is making purchases for the group. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> What insights did I gain from testing? </h3>
          <p> I learned from testers that having the default iOS/Android font
            everywhere did not look good, even though I thought it was necessary
            to include it since this was native application. After changing the
            font to a more unique and bolder design, the overall design looked
            much better. I was able to still maintain the default font for body
            text, so that it feels comfortable for users still.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> What roadblocks did I encounter? </h3>
          <p> As someone who has used an iPhone their entire life, Android design
            and style was completely new for me. It was difficult at first to
            determine how I should change my designs to fit the Android Style
            Manual, and I made many drastic differences that I later learned
            were unnecessary. Overtime, I realized it was more subtle differences,
            such as font, button style, and shadowing that really made the Android
            screens look the way they should, and I look forward to getting
            more experience with Android design now that I have been introduced to it. </p>
